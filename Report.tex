\glspl{EHR} are rapidly expanding in their use and their benefits are well known. Significant reduction in the cost of care, improved quality of care, and improved record keeping are just a few of the benefits of using an \gls{EHR}. It is for these reasons that many medical institutions are rapidly adopting \glspl{EHR}. 

An explosion of innovation has stemmed from this rapid adoption and has produced many different solutions from many different providers. Unfortunately, these solutions tend to store and transmit the information that they collect in formats that are not compatible with each other. In order to maximize the benefit received from these \glspl{EHR} they must be able to share information between different systems and locations.

This paper reports on the various aspects of the creating a framework for \gls{EHR} interoperability.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Background}
Hospitals within Sweden use electronic computer systems to store and track patient health data. Different hospitals or medical facilities use systems developed by different companies or different customized solutions from the same company. The end result is a complex network of systems that are unable to communicate with each other. When a patient moves or visits a hospital while on vacation the individual doctors must manually send patient data to each other. This is a complicated and error-prone process that potentially wastes the time and energy of everyone involved.

Define the problem and in what context (maybe contextualize, write a story, describe a scenario? a concrete relevant scenario that occurs with persons involved)

The setting of problems in \gls{EHR}/EMR \gls{interoperability} situations. Describe what the problems related to \gls{interoperability} are within healthcare. The situation in Uppsala County, why we are doing this. What is being done on \gls{interoperability} in other areas. Describe the problems related to interoperating \glspl{EHR}.
describe the ideal interoperating system

\subsection{Purpose and Scope}
To investigate the \gls{interoperability} of
\gls{EHR}/EMR systems taking in regard what
the people involved want, the limitations,
standards and organizational issues.

Explain what we will look into and why, limit the scope to what we will be discussing in the paper.

\section{Method}

\subsection{Project Organization}
 (How, and our own organization)

\subsection{Interviews}
\subsubsection{Phone interviews}

Interviews were performed with representatives of Cambio \cite{Cambio}, epSOS \cite{epSOS} and [insert your interviewees here].

(preparations, structure, outlines/protocols, focus of the interviews.
How did we prepare the interviews, how were/weren't they structured, transcribed?)

\subsubsection{Regular interviews}

Based on the relevant litterature, interview templates were produced before contact was initiated. The templates were then adapted to fit with the specific individual ranges of knowledge and sent to them beforehand to allow for them to prepare. Contact was initiated through both phone calls and email conversations, to book the time of meeting and sending the interview questions.
\\\\
During the actual interview, typically we'd be one or two people interviewing a single person as was the case for the EPJ interviews \cite{EPJ1} \cite{EPJ2}. For the Empirica interview~\cite{Empirica}, we interviewed two people at once, which was more time efficient but led to that the most experienced of the two interviewees did most of the talking.
\\\\
The CeHis interview~\cite{CeHis} was performed by four people, with four people being interviewed, two of them participating through speakerphone. This meant that it became a hybrid between a phone interview and a regular interview, resulting in that the ones physically present participated more actively. 
\\\\
The interviews were structured to focus on which problems exist today, how they are currently being dealt with and how different organizations and projects correspond to this. The interviews that were recorded were transcribed and translated to english, these transcripts are available in a seperate document available from the project coordinators.

\section{Interoperability}

\subsection{Introduction} % Introduction to what this chapter should be about. (relevant, not too long, not too short) ...Should this really be a subsection or just text?

\subsection{Definition within healthcare} %Define what \gls{interoperability} is. Talk about \gls{interoperability} in general, and also in this specific case. Why \gls{interoperability} is important and how it works.
\label{sec:interopDefinition}

\subsection{Current situation} %What the current situation is regarding \gls{interoperability}. Why it is a big problem.
\subsection{Prerequisites for interoperability on a national level}

To achieve European wide solutions for cross-border transfer of patient information certain requirements need to be fulfilled. There has to be an agreement on the definitions of data sets for both patient summaries and e-prescription, a legal framework for data transfer, a technical framework to connect the systems at each level and a working semantic \gls{interoperability}. \cite{epSOS1}

\section{Technical Standards}

\subsection{What is a Technical Standard for Computer Software?}
A technical standard is a recognized and established requirement about software systems that establishes the ``way things should be done." They are responsible for everything from the uniformity of web browsers (although not all browsers strictly conform to the standard) to the ability for nearly any laptop to connect wirelessly to any access point. Such standards specify aspects of a program such as a common format for a file or data transfer that allow different developers to develop separate software programs while allowing for \gls{interoperability} between the different systems. Software standards are the foundation for the \gls{interoperability} of different software systems.

\subsection{The Creation of a Standard}
Typically for different parties (software development companies) to agree on a specific software standard they create a software standards organization that consist of members and representatives of the various software companies who contribute ideas and opinions about making a single, unified standard addressing the data \gls{interoperability} problem that needs to be addressed.

\subsubsection{Examples of Software Standards Organizations}

\begin{itemize}
\item World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) - Responsible for web standards such as HTML, HTTP, and XML 
\item Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers Standards Association (IEEE Standards Association) - Responsible for a wide range of standards for engineering such as the 802.11 standard
\item Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) - Responsible for providing standards for new Internet related technology 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adherence to Standards}
Adherence to a particular software standard can be either mandatory required or voluntarily followed. For example, in the United States banking software must conform to security standards and regulations set forth by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Any system that does not conform to these standards faces legal action by the federal government and as such is not allowed for use by U.S. banks. On the other end of the spectrum, the standards set forth by the W3C as to how a web browser should interpret and render various web pages is a completely voluntary standard and while most popular, modern browsers do conform in the most part to these standards there are many cases where some (if not all) do not completely achieve compliance. However, they face no legal retaliation for not complying with the W3C's standards as the standards are voluntarily adhered to and not legally mandated.


\subsection{Software Standards and EHR Software}
With the growing ubiquitousness of the Internet, computers, and modern technology as well as the geographic diversity of medical talent and information it is doubtless that someday a standard specifying the transmission, storage, and format of electronic healthcare records will be developed; the benefit of such a standard is too great to be ignored for long. Such a standard will require and large organization to oversee and develop as patent data is widely varied and medical breakthroughs are discovered daily requiring such a standard to be constantly updated and modified to stay relevant. 

\subsection{The Alternative to a Future Standard For EHR Software}
The only other option for sharing healthcare records would be to have a unified software system doctors all over the world would use to view and modify patient records. However, such a solution is unrealistic as for one there are already too many \gls{EHR} software companies to reasonably plan for one, new company to globally take over the entire electronic healthcare record industry. Furthermore, with anti-trust laws as well as fair competition clauses in many countries (such as the United States) a single organization would not be legally allowed to be the sole producer of \gls{EHR} software systems.

\section{Adoption of future systems}

%Current limitations and obstacles

\subsection{Technical}
Security? Limitations for what that can technically be done?


\subsection{Legal}

\newglossaryentry{Health Care Provider}{name={Health Care Provider}, description={an individual or an institution that provides health care services in a systematic way}}

\newacronym[\glsshortpluralkey=HCPs ,\glslongpluralkey= Health Care Providers]{HCP}{HCP}{\gls{Health Care Provider}}

The new Swedish legislation provides new opportunities, but not obligations. \cite{RiR19}

\glspl{EHR} exist to promote patient safety, high quality health care and minimized cost. It is also supposed to be a source of information for the patient (ch 3, § 2). A patient journal must be kept for each patient and may not be common to several patients. The one writing in the journal is responsible for that part. All journal entries must be written in Swedish. \cite{PatientDataAct}
\\\\
The patient is not required to give his or her consent for the \gls{HCP} to act according to what the Patient Data Law dictates, except for an EHR to be shared from one caregiver to another, when gaining electronic access to records of another care unit or during unified journaling. Patients may refuse to be part of organized records (kvalitetsregister). To remove parts of a journal there has to be convincing reasons, the part being removed can't be necessary for future health care and there should be no public interest in keeping the information. Journal data may be blocked from unified journaling access but the information saying that data has been blocked and by who should still be available. A caregiver may have access to documented information only if he or she participates in the care of the patient or for other reasons need this information for their work in health care. The law also regulates periodical checking of the logs. The patient has rights to obtain certain parts of his or her medical journal and information on who has accessed it in the past.\cite{PatientDataAct}
\\\\
The Personal Data Privacy Act (1998:204) applies to the parts of the records that are managed automatically and stored in a structured fashion. The National Board of Health and Welfare has rights and obligations regarding apprehension of journals in the event of legal violations.\cite{PatientDataAct}

\subsection{Organizational}

[Emil and Erik: Current organizational issues that limit the adoption of interoperating systems.]

%Here are related items from the Empirica interview
\begin{itemize}
\item When it comes to \gls{interoperability}, technical issues and standard specifications are subordinated to legal and organizational issues. The organizational issues include common understanding from people involved in the process and getting the commitment from doctors and nurses. 
\item Clear objectives and strong project leaders with the backing of the top level management and politics are very important factors of success for \gls{EHR} projects. Continuous development and the ability to revise things are also crucial.
\item It is important to reach all the layers of the health care organization to achieve change, to engage the different groups of doctors, nurses, secretaries, technicians and not only have the software developers talk to the management section of the organization.
\item Electronic systems are changing the way doctors work and what responsibilities they have.
